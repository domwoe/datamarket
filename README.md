# Datamarket

Datamarket provides an implementation of mediated unidirectional payment channels based on Bitcoinj. Datamarket consists of a Android App, a Hub Application, and a Requester application. The Android application registers on-board smarthpone sensors together with a price on the hub. The Requester application allows to query the hub for sensors. Micropayments between requesters and sensors are achieved with payment channels connected via Hash-timelocked Contracts.

\begin{abstract}

\hspace*{12pt} In recent years, there has been a widespread expansion of data collection and complex methods to analyze such 
collected data. Everyone is constantly generating data by using a large range of computers, smartphones, and gadgets.
In addition, there is an emerging trend towards the Internet-of-Things technologies that consist
of billions of sensor nodes bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world, and creating massive amounts
of data, but with no incentive to share. 

	In order to provide an incentive for the sensor node owners to share the generated data, these sensor networks
have to initiate data markets that interested customers can subscribe to and pay for the acquired data. Bitcoin provides
an Internet-native payment mechanism and protocols on top of Bitcoin are able to support small payments and avoid 
high cumulated transaction processing costs.

	This thesis proposes a centralized secure scheme that allows data purchasing from any Internet-connected sensor
node using the Bitcoin payments. Based on micropayment channels to aggregate payments and minimize transaction fees, 
and on contracts between the protocol participants to minimize trust, the scheme allows human judgements to be taken
out of the loop and supports complete automation.

\begin{theorem}[First Theorem] \label{thm:first theorem}
	This is our first theorem.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
	And this is the proof of the first theorem with a complicated formula and a reference to Theorem \ref{thm:first theorem}.

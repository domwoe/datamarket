# Week 13 & 14 Progress

## Completed steps
1. Dropped idea of writing a custom filter provider. Instead, commited the multisigSetup transaction to the client's wallet, so we receive an "onCoinsReceived" callback from
the AbstractWalletEventListener when the server broadcasts an old teardown transaction. Client then immediately broadcasts the corresponding forfeiture transactions.
2. Prepared midterm presentation.
3. Midterm prep meeting, received feedback. Modified presentation accordingly.
4. Implemented custom blocking queue that allows batching of elements.
5. Started refactoring both client and server side code to support batching.

## Next steps
1. Complete refactoring on both client and server side.
2. Modify protobuf messages to accomodate batching (introduce lists of signed transactions, etc).
3. Test batch-based full protocol.
4. Start integration in the 3-component system.
